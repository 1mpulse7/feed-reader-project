# Project Overview

This was a project in which I was required to use a testing suite called Jasmine
to write tests for an already functioning site. Scroll towards the bottome and you'll see the results of the tests.

# Resources Used
For the asynchronous tests I read and used Mathew Cranford's article, so I could better understand
what was happening.
