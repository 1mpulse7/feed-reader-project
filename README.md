# Project Overview

This was a project in which I was required to use a testing suite called Jasmine
to write tests for an already functioning site.

# Instructions

In order to view the project, clone the repository on to your local machine
and open up in your favorite browser. The Jasmine tests can be found at the bottom of the page.

# Resources Used
For the asynchronous tests I read and used Mathew Cranford's article, so I could better understand
what was happening.

callbackhell.com to better understand callbacks, and asynchronous programming.
